 # <u>**Week 21 Challenge**</u>
This weeks challenge focused on being able to refactor code so that we could utilize apollo servers and then be able to deploy to heroku.

## <u>**Motivation**</u>
Here is a list of my motivations for this project!

- learn how to properly use graphQL and being able to deploy to heroku
- utilizing Apollo Server while running query searches with mutations
- lastly, refactoring code in order to run a fully function site working with a graphQL API
